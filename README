The circuits in this archive are the twenty largest MCNC LGSynth93 
logic synthesis circuits.  Each circuit was logic optimized in SIS using
both script.rugged and script.algebraic -- whichever script produced the
smaller output circuit was used in each case.  The circuits were then 
technology-mapped to 4-input look-up tables (LUTs) via Flowmap.

The VPACK program was then used to pack a flip flop and a LUT together into
one basic logic element (BLE) where possible.  The final netlist is in 
terms of these BLEs.  For details on the structure of a BLE and the .net
netlist format, see the VPR User's Manual.

The clocks were not routed in any of these circuits -- it is assumed 
the clock would be routed via a dedicated global resource.  The .global clk
line in these circuits tells a .net file parser that the clock is not
to be routed.
